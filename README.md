# Open_source_provenance_graph_repos
I believe it is the right time to build a provenance graph processing library for generic purpose. Existing open-source provenance graph repos are listed as:

## Open-source data collection and provenance graph construction repos
- **SPADE** provides a cross-platform distributed data provenance collection, filtration, storage, and querying service. [repo](https://github.com/ashish-gehani/SPADE)

## Open-source provenance graph analysis(including detction and forensic)
- **Krystal** is a modular framework for tactical attack discovery in audit data. [paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S016740482200222X) [repo](https://github.com/sepses/Krystal)

## Provenance graph processing for non-threat-detection purpose
- **Core Provenance Library** - A cross-platform library that enables application programmers to easily instrument their applications to collect provenance. [repo](https://code.google.com/archive/p/core-provenance-library/)
- **Trrack** â€“ A Library for Tracking Provenance on the Web. [paper](https://osf.io/wnctb/download) [repo](https://github.com/VisualStorytelling/provenance-core/)
